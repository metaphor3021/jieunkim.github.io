                    I reimagined the Korean sabangtakja, a wooden display shelf made with precise joinery. I was drawn
                    to
                    exploring how its balanced form could exist in paper alone, wanting to see how fragility might
                    become
                    quiet strength. Shaping discarded paper by hand, I felt a deep sense of care and intimacy,
                    discovering
                    how something seemingly weak can quietly support weight when treated patiently. Through lacquer and
                    layered construction, this attentive, hands-on process transformed fragile materials into a new
                    structure that is both delicate and self-standing.
