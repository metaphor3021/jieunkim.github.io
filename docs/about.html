           I work with discarded paper and other overlooked materials,  <br>
drawn to the moments when what is considered fragile or useless finds a new presence.  <br>
 <br>
In my hands, newspaper and egg cartons transformed into pulps are allowed to take shape without artificial reinforcement, <br>
revealing their innate potential to hold, to stand, and to surprise. <br>
 <br>
Each piece carries traces of time, touch, and subtle change:  <br>
colors fade, textures shift, and some pieces continue to transform even after the work is complete.  <br>
 <br>
I am fascinated by their individual evolutions, which mirror the way life itself ages, softens, and endures. <br>
 <br>
Through this practice, I hope to offer a reassurance  <br>
that the overlooked, the fragile, the seemingly insignificant can still matter.   <br>
<br>            
The work invites viewers to witness the hidden potential in ordinary materials,  <br>
and in doing so, perhaps to reflect on their own capacity to hold, to keep becoming, and to transform. <br>
