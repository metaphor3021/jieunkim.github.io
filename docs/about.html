I work with discarded paper as a structural material.  <br>
  <br>
Newspaper and egg cartons are pulped and built into volume without artificial reinforcement. Stability is generated through density, layering, and the material’s own tension. Paper is approached not as surface, but as mass.  <br>
  <br>
A material associated with speed and circulation is transformed into load-bearing form. Each work is precise, yet defined by what the material can physically sustain. Form emerges through handling and structural testing rather than imposition.  <br>
  <br>
Based in Eindhoven, I develop sculptural works that examine how fragility can operate as structure.  <br>
