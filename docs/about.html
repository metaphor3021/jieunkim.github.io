            Jieun Kim is a designer and maker who works primarily with discarded paper, creating sculptural objects that
            blur the boundaries between design and art.<br>
            <br>
            Drawn to the unpredictability of handcraft, she explores how fragile, everyday materials can be reimagined
            into
            new forms of utility and perception. <br>
            <br>
            Her work transforms paper that has already served its purpose into objects that gently disrupt visual and
            tactile expectations,
            encouraging a renewed awareness of material and touch. <br>
            <br>
            Born in Korea and based in the Netherlands, she is currently studying at Design Academy Eindhoven,
            where she continues to explore the boundaries between material transformation and contemporary craft.<br>
