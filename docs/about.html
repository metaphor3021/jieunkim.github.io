        Jieun Kim is a designer and maker who works primarily with discarded paper, creating sculptural objects that
        blur the boundaries between design and art.<br>

        Drawn to the unpredictability of handcraft, she explores how fragile, everyday materials can be reimagined into
        new forms of utility and perception. <br>
        <br>
        Her work transforms paper that has already served its purpose into objects that gently disrupt visual and
        tactile expectations,
        encouraging a renewed awareness of material and touch. <br>
        <br>
        Her practice is currently based in the Netherlands, where she continues to explore the boundaries between
        material transformation and contemporary craft.<br>
