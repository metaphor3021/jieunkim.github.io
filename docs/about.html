I work with discarded paper as a structural material.<br>
<br>
Newspaper and egg cartons are pulped and built into volume without artificial reinforcement. Stability is determined by the material itself. Depending on how it is layered and handled, paper can carry weight or remain thin while holding its own form.
<br>
<br>
Paper is treated as matter rather than surface. The forms are precise, but always constrained by what the material can physically sustain.<br>
<br>
Over time, the material continues to shift subtly with light, air, and use.<br>
